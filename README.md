Turning Bits into bright ideas. A logic circuit that converts binary input into decimal output using 74LS47 and 7-segment display
This project is a simple yet powerful demonstration of digital logic at work — a Binary to Decimal Converter using a 7-segment LED display and logic ICs. It takes a 4-bit binary input through DIP switches and converts it into its equivalent decimal number, which is then displayed on a common-anode 7-segment display.

The core of the circuit relies on a 74LS47 BCD to 7-segment decoder, which interprets binary-coded inputs and lights up the correct segments to show numbers from 0 to 9. This project showcases the foundational principles of digital electronics, logic decoding, and human-readable output in a hands-on, visual format.

Perfect for students and beginners, this converter is a bridge between raw binary data and real-world understanding — bringing bits to life through glowing segments.
